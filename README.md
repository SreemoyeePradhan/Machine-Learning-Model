# Machine-Learning-Model
Built my first machine learning model in Python using the scikit-learn library.
## PROJECT DETAILS
The primary objective was to predict a numerical target variable by applying and comparing two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The intent was to understand how different algorithms perform on the same dataset and to gain hands-on experience with key stages of a typical ML pipeline—from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
The dataset, loaded via a CSV file, was first explored to understand its structure and integrity. Basic data analysis was performed using functions like head(), info(), and shape(), followed by handling of missing values by dropping null entries. The data was then split into features (X) and target (y), and further partitioned into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio through train_test_split.
Two regression models were implemented. The first was Linear Regression, which served as a simple, interpretable baseline. The second was the Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning method that typically provides better performance due to its non-linear nature and ability to reduce overfitting. Both models were trained on the training data and used to predict on the test set. Their performance was evaluated using the R² score, and the predicted vs. actual values were visualized using line plots to observe how closely the models followed the true trend.
Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn were incorporated to enhance interpretability. A correlation heatmap helped understand relationships among variables, while line plots gave a visual comparison of model predictions against actual values. These visuals provided valuable insight into model behavior and data distribution.
This project successfully demonstrated the end-to-end workflow of a regression problem and offered a side-by-side comparison of a linear vs. non-linear approach. It highlighted the strengths of ensemble methods in capturing complex patterns and showcased basic data handling and model training techniques.
Tools and technologies used in this project include Google Colab, Python, and essential ML libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The project can be further extended by incorporating additional evaluation metrics such as MAE and MSE, plotting residuals, tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, and introducing cross-validation for more robust performance estimation.
